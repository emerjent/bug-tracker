/**
 * A person's picture, or their initials on a colour derived from their name
 * (#290). Used everywhere a person is shown, so they look the same on every
 * page.
 *
 * Decorative: the name is always written next to it, so the whole thing is
 * `aria-hidden` and the image has `alt=""`. A screen reader says the name
 * once, not "Ada Lovelace Ada Lovelace".
 *
 * The box has a fixed size and the initials sit underneath the image, so:
 *  - while the picture loads, the initials are already there
 *  - if it fails (a dead URL, a blocked host), it's hidden and the initials
 *    show, with nothing moving.
 *
 * The image is requested with no referrer, so the image host doesn't learn
 * which page of this app the person was reading.
