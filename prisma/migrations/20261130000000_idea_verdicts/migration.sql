-- Ideas take verdicts instead of upvotes (#idea-verdicts). Each person gives an
-- idea a good, bad or neutral verdict carrying 1 vote (up to 5 for a manager
-- or merger agent). When good minus bad reaches the project's ideaThreshold, a
-- manager agent converts the idea to an issue. Issues then only need
-- confirmation; idea verdicts do not carry over.
